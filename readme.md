# tak-board

A representation of a Tak board in 2D.

[Click here to see the half-implemented current state.](http://tehshrike.github.io/tak-board/)

## My goal

The ability to represent Tak board states in two dimensions for use in implementing online games.

Board states are generated by [tak-game](https://github.com/TehShrike/tak-game).

## My priorities

- the board state should be obvious without having to click or hover.  You should be able to print it out and put it in a newspaper as a puzzle.
- an abstract board sticking faithfully to two dimensions, no faking 3D with shadows or angles
- at a very quick glance, you should be able to see which squares are owned by which player
- at a slightly longer glance you should notice where standing stones and capstones are
- should look good

## I need help!

I'll try to make something reasonable, but I would love help from the Tak community.

Open Github issues or [ping me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TehShrike) if you have any questions or ideas.

If you come up with a design that you think looks reasonable, open a pull request, I want to see it!

## To implement your own designs

You'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TehShrike/tak-board.git
npm install
npm run watchjs
npm run watchcss # in another tab
```

Open up index.html in your browser to see how it looks.

Edit [board.html](https://github.com/TehShrike/tak-board/blob/gh-pages/board.html) and [board-style.css](https://github.com/TehShrike/tak-board/blob/gh-pages/board-style.css) to change the design.  The mustache-style templating is rendered by [Ractive](http://docs.ractivejs.org/latest/mustaches).

If you want to try a different board, edit the board state at the top of index.js.

## Todo

- plop in more than one view of the same board state, with different template/css files for each
- to try: left half stack, right half top-piece
- to try: stack, with top piece in the center
- to try: stack, with top piece in border and standing stone/capstone in center
